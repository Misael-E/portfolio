					As a recent graduate from the University of Calgary with a
					Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, specializing in
					Software Engineering, I am excited to embark on my
					professional journey in the tech industry. During my time at
					the university, I had the opportunity to work with various
					startup companies. This experience allowed me to enhance my
					skills in technologies like ReactJS, Python, SQL, Google
					Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Working
					in these dynamic environments taught me the importance of
					adaptability, multitasking, and continuous learning. Apart
					from my academic and professional endeavors, I have a keen
					interest in building and benchmarking PCs, utilizing the
					latest technologies in the market. Currently, my primary
					interest lies in deepening my understanding of data
					structures and algorithmsâ€”a passion I am eager to apply in a
					full-time role. With a blend of academic knowledge and
					practical experience, I am ready to contribute to and grow
					within the tech industry.
